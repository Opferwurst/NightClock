# NightClock
This was my first project after joining the [Reading Hackspace](http://rlab.org.uk/).  It exposed me to a number of new techniques and software.

* 2D CAD and laser cutting for the physical clock.  CAD models in dxf format and some cutting files from RDWorks (used by the hackspace laser cutter) are included in the cad folder.
* PCB Design using [Kicad](http://kicad-pcb.org/).  This is the first PCB I have designed.  I had it made in China by [PCBWay](http://www.pcbway.com/).
* Programming the ESP8266 and neopixels for the clock electronics.  I used [Platformio](http://platformio.org/) to program the ESP8266 and manage the libraries.  It uses the core Arduino model for software development, but I prefer it to using the Arduino IDE, which I find frustrating.  I have also used the platformio-ide plugin for [Atom](https://atom.io/), which also works well.
