# NightClock
An ESP8266 based clock intended for the bedroom.  It uses neopixels to light one of 12 segments giving the hour and approximate minutes, and maybe seconds, who knows...

##  Project elements

This project has been chosen to allow me to explore a number of new areas:

1. ESP8266 programming
2. 2D CAD to create the physical clock which will be lasercut from acrylic sheets
3. Creation of a PCB using Kicad
